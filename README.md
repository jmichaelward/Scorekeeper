Scorekeeper
===========

A basic web-based application to keep track of game scores for a set of players.


Version 0.1 release notes
=========================
This is a simple implementation of a scorekeeper app. As of v0.1, it lacks many features that might be expected for this
kind of application (e.g., ending games, tracking scores for multiple games, database integration, form validation, 
sanitization of form inputs).

Many of these expected features will be implemented in future versions to come.
